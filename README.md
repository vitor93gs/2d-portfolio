# 2DPortfolio

## Welcome to my 2DPortfolio Game! This project is built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/), featuring a custom map created using [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/).

In this interactive 2D house exploration game, you can wander through a symbolic house and interact with various objects. Discover hidden surprises and enjoy the detailed environment.

### Big shoutout to [@JSLegendDev](https://www.youtube.com/@JSLegendDev) for the step-by-step guidance and support in making this project possible. Check out their GitHub for more awesome projects and tutorials!
